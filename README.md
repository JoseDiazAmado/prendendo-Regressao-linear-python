Linear Regression is the great entry path in the amazing world of Machine Learning! and the most simplest algorithm to learn .
I will focus more on the code then theory because code is more fun :) but just to fire up the resting linear regression neurons in your brain.
Linear Regression : It is method to find pattern with a “Best Fit Line” ( therefore, “Linear” get it ?) in your data.
Looks something like this (for any x or y axis)
Fig: Linear Regression ExampleIn this example we will be using the “ load_boston” dataset i.e. the boston housing pricing dataset from scikit learn.
